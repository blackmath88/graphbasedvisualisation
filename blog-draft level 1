GitHub is amazing.

GitHub is also a very particular kind of punishment.

Because GitHub shows you **one README at a time**.

And when the topic is “Copilot prompts / prompt libraries / system prompts / agent instructions / whatever the internet invented this week”, the standard workflow becomes:

1. Open repo  
2. Scroll README  
3. Open 7 links  
4. Forget why you came  
5. Repeat until you are basically a browser tab yourself

So I built a tiny thing to make the invisible structure visible:

A **Prompt Library Navigator** — a graph-based index of prompt repositories.

Not a platform.  
Not a database.  
Not an enterprise architecture.  
Just **one HTML file** that gives you the *shape* of the ecosystem.

## Level 1.1: The “Static Snapshot” Trick

In my hub-and-spoke framework, this is **Graph Visualization Level 1.1**:

- ✅ Single self-contained HTML  
- ✅ Embedded dataset (JSON in the file)  
- ✅ Interactive exploration  
- ❌ No live connectors  
- ❌ No backend  
- ❌ No “always fresh” data

It’s basically a **living screenshot**.
Interactive, but not connected.

That’s the point: you can ship it fast.  
And it’s already impressive because humans don’t need *more data* — they need *structure*.

## What the map shows

Instead of starting with “Which repo do I know?”, you start with:

**“What do I need?”**

So the map uses a simple model:

- **Topics** are anchor nodes (cluster centers)
- **Repos** connect to one or more topics
- **Node size** ≈ star count (a rough “gravity” signal)
- Click → inspect  
- Filter → narrow the ecosystem  
- Switch to list view → browse like a normal person

If GitHub is a bookshelf, this is a **library floor plan**.

## Why this matters for Copilot adoption (aka: my day job)

In Copilot adoption, the hardest part is rarely “the feature”.

The hard part is **navigation**:

- Where do we start?
- What’s relevant for business users vs. devs vs. architects?
- Which prompt libraries are actually useful, and which are… let’s say… “adventurous”?

A map is a surprisingly good answer because it turns a messy pile of links into:

- **clusters** (themes)
- **bridges** (multi-topic repos)
- **islands** (niche repos)
- and the occasional **Dark Forest** (you know what I mean)

That last one matters: business audiences need safety rails.  
A good map doesn’t just show everything — it shows **what’s safe to click**.

## The 30-second demo script (steal this)

If you want to show this to leadership without losing them in nerd land:

1. “This is the prompt ecosystem as a map.”
2. “Click a topic: it filters instantly.”
3. “Click a repo: you get the ‘why’ and the link.”
4. “Switch to list view: it becomes a curated catalog.”
5. “This is one file. No backend. It’s a proof of concept.”

Then stop talking and let them click.

## Why this works psychologically

People don’t remember lists.  
People remember **shapes**.

A good graph gives you:

- a sense of scale (“oh, this is huge”)
- a sense of center (“this is the hub”)
- and a sense of direction (“this is where I should start”)

It’s the difference between reading a travel blog and looking at a metro map.

## Side quest for literature students (and other brave souls)

Because yes — I’m also a literature scholar — here’s a fun challenge:

Take any story and map it as a constellation:

- nodes = characters / locations / themes  
- edges = interactions / co-occurrence / conflict  
- signals = importance / faction / “betrayal risk” 😇

**Download this system prompt** and try it yourself:

👉 **Story Constellation System Prompt (download):** `story-constellation-system-prompt.txt`

The catch: the **segmentation and data structuring is on you**.

Which is the whole point.

You’ll learn something usable for once. 😉

### “Would this work with the full text of a whole book?”

Yes — with a realistic constraint:

- If you paste an entire novel into a chat window: you’ll hit limits.
- But if you **chunk the text** (chapters/scenes) and extract structured events per chunk, it works well.
- Then you merge the outputs into a node/edge dataset and visualize.

So: *not one prompt, one book.*  
More like: *one pipeline, one book.*

## What’s next: Level 1.2 (optional upgrade)

Level 1.2 would keep the same UI, but swap the dataset source:

- Live GitHub API for stars, topics, last updated
- Optional scraping of README headings (as “subtopics”)
- Auto-rebuild the map weekly

But honestly?

Level 1.1 already does the job:
It proves the concept: **graphs make navigation humane**.

## If you want to build your own

If you want a template, steal the core recipe:

1. pick a small ecosystem (10–50 things)
2. define 2–3 node types (keep it simple)
3. add 2 signals (size + color)
4. add 2 interactions (click details + filter)
5. ship as one HTML file

That’s it.

You’re not building a platform.  
You’re building a **lens**.

And sometimes that’s the real productivity hack.
